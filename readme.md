Hangman Exercise from The Modern React Bootcamp (Hooks, Context, NextJS, Router) by Colt Steele on Udemy

Starter code was provided (available for comparison in react-hangman-starter.zip).

What I did:
1. Added keys to buttons for React.
2. Displayed number of wrong guesses.
3. Conditionally render buttons based on number of allowed wrong guesses.
4. Made alt text for the image based on number of wrong guesses.
5. Used a given list of English words and a function to get a random one to set initial state and retrieve a new word on restarting the game.
6. Adding reset functionality in a restart button.
7. Refactored letter buttons into an AlphaButtons component.
